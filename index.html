			(with Stephane Auray and Aurelien Eyquem), <em>Journal of Economic Dynamics & Control</em>,
			August 2019, 105, pp. 107-133.<p>
		
		<p><em>Abstract:</em>   Following the Great Recession, U.S. government debt levels exceeded 100%
  			of output.  We develop a macroeconomic model to evaluate the role of
  			various shocks during and after the Great Recession; labor market shocks
  			have the greatest impact on macroeconomic activity.  We then evaluate the
  			consequences of using alternative fiscal policy instruments to implement a
  			fiscal austerity program to return the debt-output ratio to its pre-Great
  			Recession level.  Our welfare analysis reveals that there is not much
  			difference between applying fiscal austerity through government spending,
  			the labor income tax, or the consumption tax; using the capital income tax
			is welfare-reducing.</p>

	  <p><em>Abstract:</em> We solve the Ramsey-optimal tax plan for a small open economy with an
  			endogenously-determined real exchange rate.  The open economy
  			constrains the government's setting of the capital income tax rate since
  			physical capital cannot be dominated in rate of return by foreign assets.
  			However, the endogenous real exchange rate loosens this constraint relative
  			to a one good open economy model in which the real exchange rate is
  			necessarily fixed.  We find that, the dynamics of the two good small open
  			economy model more closely resemble those of a closed economy model than a
  			one good small open economy model.</p>

	<p><em>Amstract:</em> Raising children takes considerable time, particularly for women. Yet, the role of childcare time has received scant attention in the macroeconomics literature. We develop a life-cycle model in which the time dimension of childcare plays a central role. An important contribution of the paper is estimation of the parameters of a childcare production function using data on primary and secondary childcare time as reported in the American Time Use Survey (2003--2015). The model does a better job matching the observed life-cycle patterns of womens' time use than a model without childcare. Our counterfactual experiments show that the increase in the relative wage of women since the 1960s is an important factor in the increase in womens' work time; changes in fertility associated with the baby boom play a smaller role, and changes in the price of durables are found to have a negligible effect. We consider the effects of cheaper daycare. Not surprisingly, this experiment leads to greater use of daycare and more time allocated to market work. A knock-on effect of cheaper daycare is a substantial decline in primary childcare time.</p>

	      <p><em>Abstract:</em> Tax-based deficit reduction experiments for the U.S. and
	      EMU-12 are conducted using an open economy model.  In welfare terms,
	      raising the consumption tax is the least costly, followed by the labor
	      income tax, then the capital income tax. Use of an open economy model
	      means that the incidence of the consumption tax is borne in part by
	      foreign producers.  Among revenue-neutral tax experiments, partially
	      replacing the capital income tax is welfare-enhancing, although there are
	      short term losses. Replacing labor income tax revenue with a consumption
	      tax improves international competitiveness and is welfare-improving.</p>

	      (with Damba Lkhagvasuren)
	      <em>Journal of Monetary Economics</em>, October 2015</p>


	      <p><em>Abstract:</em> It is well known that the Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides
		model exhibits a strong trade-off between cyclical unemployment
		fluctuations and the size of rents to employment. Introducing endogenous
		job search effort reduces the strength of the trade-off while bringing the
		model closer to the data. Ignoring worker search effort leads to a large
		upward bias in the elasticity of matches with respect to vacancies.
		Merging the American Time Use Survey and the Current Population Survey, new
		evidence in support of procyclical search effort is presented. Average
		search effort of the unemployed is subject to cyclical composition

	      <p><em>Abstract:</em> In a neoclassical growth model with life-cycle

	      <em>Economic Journal</em>, 123 (568), May 2013, pages 455-473.</p>


	      <p><em>Abstract:</em> Capturing the boom phase of Pigou cycles and resolving
	      the comovement problem requires positive sectoral comovement.  This
	      paper addresses these observations using a two sector New Keynesian
	      model.  Price rigidities dampen movements in the relative price of
	      durables following a monetary policy shock.  Durables and nondurables
	      are estimated to be complements in utility, allowing for a resolution
	      of the comovement problem for modest degrees of price rigidity.
	      Nominal rigidities also make firms forward-looking in their pricing
	      behaviour which leads to relative price dynamics that generate positive
	      sectoral comovement in the boom phase of a Pigou cycle.</p>

	      <p><em>Abstract:</em>
	      A widely cited failing of real business cycle models is their 
	      inability to account for the cyclical patterns of financial
	      variables. Perhaps less well known is the fact that the return to capital
	      and equity are identical in the neoclassical growth model.  This paper
	      constructs a measure of the return to business capital for the U.S. The S&P
	      500 return is roughly six times more volatile than the return to
	      business capital. Owing to the equivalence between the returns to capital
	      and equity in the neoclassical growth model, papers in the real business
	      cycle literature that successfully account for the time series variation
	      in the S&P 500 return must fail to account for the time series properties
	      of the return to capital. A fairly basic real business cycle model
	      captures most of the observed variability in the return to capital. What
	      is needed is a theory of the stock market that breaks the equivalence
	      between the returns to equity and capital.</p>

	      Calibration has become a standard tool of macroeconomics. This paper
	      extends and refines the calibration methodology along several important
	      dimensions. First, accounting for home production is important both in
	      measuring calibration targets and in organizing the data in a
	      model-consistent fashion. For this reason, thinking about home production
	      is important even if the model under consideration does not include home
	      production. Second, investment-specific technological change is included
	      because of its strong balanced growth parameter restrictions. Third, the
	      measurement strategy is laid out as transparently as possible so that
	      others can easily replicate the underlying calculations.</p>

		Review</EM> (with David Andolfatto) 44 (1), February 2003, pages 1-30.</p>

	      <p><EM>Abstract:</EM> 
	      This paper investigates the role of beliefs over monetary policy in
	      propagating the effects of monetary policy shocks within the context of a
	      dynamic, stochastic general equilibrium model.  In our model, monetary
	      policy periodically switches between low and high money growth regimes.
	      When individuals are unable to observe the regime directly, they 
	      form inferences over regime-type based on historical money growth rates.
	      For an empirically plausible money growth process, beliefs
	      evolve slowly in the wake of a regime change.  As a result, our model is
	      able to capture some of the observed persistence of real and nominal
	      variables following such a regime change.</p>

	      <p><EM>Abstract:</EM> Empirically, real wages exhibit relatively little
	      cyclical variation and a weak cyclical pattern. Early real business cycle
	      models predict, to the contrary, large, procyclical real wage
	      movements. Incorporating efficiency wages into a real business cycle
	      environment would seem promising since one prediction from the efficiency
	      wage literature is real wage rigidity. This paper evaluates a common
	      microfoundation for efficiency wages, the shirking model, with respect to
	      its predictions for real wages within a real business cycle-style
	      model. Simulations of the model reveal that it can generate dampened, but
	      still strongly procyclical real wage behavior.</p>

	      <p><EM>Abstract:</EM> In this paper, we investigate the extent to which
	      changes in U.S. labour market policy in the 1980s may have
	      contributed to the emergence of an unemployment rate gap between
	      Canada and the United States. In that decade, unemployment
	      insurance benefits became taxable, income tax rates fell
	      substantially, and various administrative changes were made that
	      effectively tightened unemployment insurance eligibility
	      requirements. These policy changes are evaluated in the context of
	      a computable equilibrium model of the labour market. Our estimates
	      suggest that all of these reforms together can account for no more
	      than a 0.4 percentage point decline in U.S. natural rate of
	      unemployment; a combined effect which accounts for 20 percent of

	      <p><em>Abstract:</em> Wage and unemployment responses to changes in economic
	      environment are compared for efficiency wage and frictional models. Changes
	      in aggregate demand, persistence of job-specific shocks, cost of living,
	      and unemployment benefits are considered. Wages and unemployment move in
	      the same direction in the two models, except that an upward shift in
	      aggregate labor demand can reduce the real wage in the efficiency wage, but
	      not the frictional, model. In a numberical simulation calibrated to
	      U.S. data, real productivity shocks in the efficiency wage model yield a
	      ratio of unemployment to wage variability close to that of the United
	      States.</p>

	      <p><EM>Abstract:</EM> Conventional wisdom is that if public policy can
	      affect the growth rate of the economy, the welfare implications of
	      alternative policies will be large.  In this paper, a stochastic,
	      dynamic general equilibrium model with endogenous growth and money is
	      examined.  In this setting, inflation lowers growth through its effect
	      on the return to work.  However, the welfare costs of higher inflation
	      are modest. The endogenous labor supply is important in producing this
	      result.</p>

			99(4), Fourth Quarter 2017, pp. 337-350.</p>
		<p><em>Abstract:</em> Can the neoclassical growth model generate fluctuations in the return to capital similar to those observed in the United States? Equating stock market returns with the return to capital, the bulk of the literature concludes that it cannot. This article makes two contributions. First is an equivalence for the neoclassical growth model between a stock market return and a return based on income and capital stock data. While the stock market return is extremely volatile, the income-based return is not. Second is the finding that the neoclassical growth model with shocks to labor productivity alone can account for the bulk of the observed volatility of the income-based return to capital (expressed relative to the volatility of income) but little of the volatility of the stock market return. Simultaneously explaining the volatility of the two measures of the return to capital within the neoclassical model will require a theory of the stock market that breaks our return-equivalence results.</p>

	  <p><em>Abstract:</em> How should governments choose tax rates when they face competition from
		  other jurisdictions?  This questions is answered by solving for the Nash
		  equilibrium of the game played between Ramsey planners in a two good, two
		  country open economy macroeconomic model.  It is shown, analytically,
		  that the planers do not tax capital income in the long run.  Short term
		  results, obtained computationally, reveal that the government of the
		  larger country manages the path of the real exchange rate in order to
		  manipulates its smaller rival's choice of tax rates.  Tax competition
		  does not lead to a "race to the bottom."

	      Household Revolution: Childcare, Housework, and Female Labor Force
	      Participation''</a> (with Emanuela Cardia)</p>
	  
	  <p><em>Abstract:</em> Over the twentieth century, the amount of time that
	    married women devoted to working in the market increased dramatically.
	    This paper explores the implications for the allocation of women's time
	    stemming from: (1) the durable goods revolution associated with the
	    introduction of new technologies, from running water to modern appliances,
	    that significantly reduced the time demands of home production; (2) the
	    increase in the relative wage of women, from roughly 50% to over 80%; and
	    (3) changes in childcare requirements associated with changes in fertility
	    patterns.  To do so, we construct a life-cycle model with home production
	    and childcare constraints.  The parameters of the childcare production
	    function are chosen to match micro evidence from U.S. time use data.  We
	    find that the increase in the relative wage of women is the most important
	    explanation of the increase in married women's market work time over the
	    twentieth century.  Increases in relative wages and decreases in fertility
	    can also explain a large part of the observed decrease in housework.  The
	    model find that the the declining price of durable goods has an appreciable
	    effect only since 1980.</p>

	    (with David Andolfatto)</p>


	  <p><em>Abstract:</em> Andolfatto and Gomme (2003) find evidence that Canadian
	    monetary policy appears to alternate between high and low money growth
	    rate regimes, and that private-sector belief formation over these
	    unobserved regimes could induce significant persistence in the
	    propagation of monetary policy shocks. In this paper, we examine the
	    sensitivity of these conclusions by re-estimating the data allowing for
	    the possibility of multiple regimes. In doing so, we find evidence of
	    three (rather than two) distinct monetary policy regimes. In particular,
	    we find that one policy regime is characterized by high money growth with
	    moderate variability. The other two policy regimes are characterized by a
	    common low money growth rate; they are distinguished primarily by their
	    variability (high and low). A simulation exercise based on our
	    three-regime model reveals an improvement in accounting for the behavior
	    of the Canadian economy over some episodes; notably, the sharp increase
	    in interest rates and the curtailment of economic activity in the early
	    1980s.</p>

	  <p><em>Abstract:</em> Life-cycle patterns of income, earnings, consumption, labor supply, and
	    wealth vary systematically across educational groups. Human capital theory
	    explains different educational choices in terms of parameters describing
	    tastes and technology. We ask whether differences in these parameters are
	    also consistent with other patterns of behavior. Our preliminary findings
	    suggest that no single form of parameter heterogeneity will be able to
	    account for the joint behavior of life-cycle choices. </p>

	<p><EM>Abstract:</EM> Government expenditures are large when measured
	as a proportion of government spending or relative to GNP. This
	fact is incorporated into an endogenous growth model in which
	education produces new human capital. Capital in the education
	sector is provided by government and financed by distortionary
	taxes. To incorporate property taxes, an important source of
	revenues for schooling, household production is incorporated into
	the model with household capital representing the property tax
	base. The model is calibrated to match key first moment properties
	of the post-war U.S. economy. Different mixes of labor income,
	capital income and property taxes are analyzed with regard to their
	consequences for the welfare of the representative household. In
	general, taxes have two opposing effects: higher taxes tend to
	retard growth and reduce welfare; however, when used to finance
	educational expenditures, taxes promote human capital accumulation
	and so growth which is welfare-enhancing.</p>

	requires capital and labor while period utility depends on
	consumption and leisure. The most important sufficient conditions
	for increased money growth to reduce output in the long run are:
	(1) the crosspartial derivative of the production function is
	  non-negative, and (2) the crosspartial derivative of the period
	  utility function is non-negative.</p>
