    Economics, </EM> 32 (1), August 1993, pp. 51-77.

<p></p>

    <EM>Abstract:</EM> Conventional wisdom is that if public policy can
    affect the growth rate of the economy, the welfare implications of
    alternative policies will be large.  In this paper, a stochastic,
    dynamic general equilibrium model with endogenous growth and money is
    examined.  In this setting, inflation lowers growth through its effect
    on the return to work.  However, the welfare costs of higher inflation
    are modest. The endogenous labor supply is important in producing this
    result.

<em>Abstract:</em> Wage and unemployment responses to changes in economic
environment are compared for efficiency wage and frictional models. Changes
in aggregate demand, persistence of job-specific shocks, cost of living,
and unemployment benefits are considered. Wages and unemployment move in
the same direction in the two models, except that an upward shift in
aggregate labor demand can reduce the real wage in the efficiency wage, but
not the frictional, model. In a numberical simulation calibrated to
U.S. data, real productivity shocks in the efficiency wage model yield a
ratio of unemployment to wage variability close to that of the United
States.

<EM>Abstract:</EM> A real business cycle model with two types of
    agents, workers and entrepreneurs, is simulated to see if it can
    account for some stylized facts characterizing postwar U.S. business
    cycle fluctuations, such as the countercyclical movement of labor's
    share of income, and the acyclical behavior of real wages.  It
    can. There exists an economy-wide market for contingent claims.  On
    this market workers purchase insurance from entrepreneurs, through
    optimal labor contracts, against losses in income due to business cycle
    fluctuations. Insurance flows protecting workers against aggregate
    cyclical risk are calculated to be less than one percent of labor
    income.

<EM>Abstract:</EM> In 1972, the Canadian Federal government implemented a
wide-ranging set of reforms to the nation's unemployment insurance
system. The economic impact of these reforms are evaluated in the context
of a dynamic general equilibrium model of labor-market search. A calibrated
version of the model estimates that the 1972 reforms had only a modest
impact on unemployment, but led to a significant increase in the rate of
labor-market turnover, particularly on flows into and out of the labor
force. The model also estimates that on net, the reforms likely contributed
to an increase in social welfare by reducing the level of idiosyncratic
income risk.

	<EM>Abstract:</EM> In this paper, we investigate the extent to which
	changes in U.S. labour market policy in the 1980s may have
	contributed to the emergence of an unemployment rate gap between
	Canada and the United States. In that decade, unemployment
	insurance benefits became taxable, income tax rates fell
	substantially, and various administrative changes were made that
	effectively tightened unemployment insurance eligibility
	requirements. These policy changes are evaluated in the context of
	a computable equilibrium model of the labour market. Our estimates
	suggest that all of these reforms together can account for no more
	than a 0.4 percentage point decline in U.S. natural rate of
	unemployment; a combined effect which accounts for 20 percent of
	the unemployment rate gap.

     <EM>Abstract:</EM> Empirically, real wages exhibit relatively little
cyclical variation and a weak cyclical pattern. Early real business cycle
models predict, to the contrary, large, procyclical real wage
movements. Incorporating efficiency wages into a real business cycle
environment would seem promising since one prediction from the efficiency
wage literature is real wage rigidity. This paper evaluates a common
microfoundation for efficiency wages, the shirking model, with respect to
its predictions for real wages within a real business cycle-style
model. Simulations of the model reveal that it can generate dampened, but
still strongly procyclical real wage behavior.

An innovation in this paper is to introduce a time-to-build technology for

finding is that the two anomalies that have plagued all household

investment, and household investment leading business investment over the

     <EM>Abstract:</EM> 
This paper investigates the role of beliefs over monetary policy in
propagating the effects of monetary policy shocks within the context of a
dynamic, stochastic general equilibrium model.  In our model, monetary
policy periodically switches between low and high money growth regimes.
When individuals are unable to observe the regime directly, they 
form inferences over regime-type based on historical money growth rates.
For an empirically plausible money growth process, beliefs
evolve slowly in the wake of a regime change.  As a result, our model is
able to capture some of the observed persistence of real and nominal
variables following such a regime change.

     <EM>Abstract:</EM> 
Calibration has become a standard tool of macroeconomics. This paper
extends and refines the calibration methodology along several important
dimensions. First, accounting for home production is important both in
measuring calibration targets and in organizing the data in a
model-consistent fashion. For this reason, thinking about home production
is important even if the model under consideration does not include home
production. Second, investment-specific technological change is included
because of its strong balanced growth parameter restrictions. Third, the
measurement strategy is laid out as transparently as possible so that
others can easily replicate the underlying calculations. The data and

<em>Review of Economic Dynamics</em> 14 (2), April 2011, pages 262-278.

<p></p>

<em>Abstract:</em>
  A widely cited failing of real business cycle models is their 
  inability to account for the cyclical patterns of financial
  variables. Perhaps less well known is the fact that the return to capital
  and equity are identical in the neoclassical growth model.  This paper
  constructs a measure of the return to business capital for the U.S. The S&P
  500 return is roughly six times more volatile than the return to
  business capital. Owing to the equivalence between the returns to capital
  and equity in the neoclassical growth model, papers in the real business
  cycle literature that successfully account for the time series variation
  in the S&P 500 return must fail to account for the time series properties
  of the return to capital. A fairly basic real business cycle model
  captures most of the observed variability in the return to capital. What
  is needed is a theory of the stock market that breaks the equivalence
  between the returns to equity and capital.

<em>Abstract:</em> Several approaches to finding the second-order

  <em>Economic Journal</em>, 123 (568), May 2013, pages 455-473.

<p></p>

<em>Abstract:</em> Capturing the boom phase of Pigou cycles and resolving
    the comovement problem requires positive sectoral comovement.  This
    paper addresses these observations using a two sector New Keynesian
    model.  Price rigidities dampen movements in the relative price of
    durables following a monetary policy shock.  Durables and nondurables
    are estimated to be complements in utility, allowing for a resolution
    of the comovement problem for modest degrees of price rigidity.
    Nominal rigidities also make firms forward-looking in their pricing
    behaviour which leads to relative price dynamics that generate positive
    sectoral comovement in the boom phase of a Pigou cycle.

<em>Abstract:</em>   Reasonably calibrated versions of the Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides search
  and matching model of unemployment underpredict, by a wide margin, the
  volatility of vacancies, unemployment, and the vacancies-unemployment
  ratio -- variables at the heart of this model.  These shortcomings
  motivate the introduction of worker search effort that permits the
  unemployed to take direct action to affect the outcome of their labor
  market search. With this modification in place, the benchmark model
  captures the bulk of the standard deviation of unemployment, vacancies,
  and the vacancies-unemployment ratio.

<em>Abstract:</em> Tax-based deficit reduction experiments for the U.S. and
  EMU-12 are conducted using an open economy model.  In welfare terms,
  raising the consumption tax is the least costly, followed by the labor
  income tax, then the capital income tax. Use of an open economy model
  means that the incidence of the consumption tax is borne in part by
  foreign producers.  Among revenue-neutral tax experiments, partially
  replacing the capital income tax is welfare-enhancing, although there are
  short term losses. Replacing labor income tax revenue with a consumption
  tax improves international competitiveness and is welfare-improving.

    Household Revolution: Childcare, Housework,and Female Labor Force
    Participation''</a> (with Emanuela Cardia)

<p></p>

<em>Abstract:</em> Over the twentieth century, the amount of time that
married women devoted to working in the market increased dramatically.
This paper explores the implications for the allocation of women's time
stemming from: (1) the durable goods revolution associated with the
introduction of new technologies, from running water to modern appliances,
that significantly reduced the time demands of home production; (2) the
increase in the relative wage of women, from roughly 50% to over 80%; and
(3) changes in childcare requirements associated with changes in fertility
patterns.  To do so, we construct a life-cycle model with home production
and childcare constraints.  The parameters of the childcare production
function are chosen to match micro evidence from U.S. time use data.  We
find that the increase in the relative wage of women is the most important
explanation of the increase in married women's market work time over the
twentieth century.  Increases in relative wages and decreases in fertility
can also explain a large part of the observed decrease in housework.  The
model find that the the declining price of durable goods has an appreciable
effect only since 1980.

<LI> <a href="3regime.pdf">``Estimating Canadian Monetary Policy Regimes''</a>
    (with David Andolfatto)

<p></p>

<em>Abstract:</em> Andolfatto and Gomme (2003) find evidence that Canadian
  monetary policy appears to alternate between high and low money growth
  rate regimes, and that private-sector belief formation over these
  unobserved regimes could induce significant persistence in the
  propagation of monetary policy shocks. In this paper, we examine the
  sensitivity of these conclusions by re-estimating the data allowing for
  the possibility of multiple regimes. In doing so, we find evidence of
  three (rather than two) distinct monetary policy regimes. In particular,
  we find that one policy regime is characterized by high money growth with
  moderate variability. The other two policy regimes are characterized by a
  common low money growth rate; they are distinguished primarily by their
  variability (high and low). A simulation exercise based on our
  three-regime model reveals an improvement in accounting for the behavior
  of the Canadian economy over some episodes; notably, the sharp increase
  in interest rates and the curtailment of economic activity in the early
  1980s.

<p></p>

<em>Abstract:</em> Life-cycle patterns of income, earnings, consumption, labor supply, and
wealth vary systematically across educational groups. Human capital theory
explains different educational choices in terms of parameters describing
tastes and technology. We ask whether differences in these parameters are
also consistent with other patterns of behavior. Our preliminary findings
suggest that no single form of parameter heterogeneity will be able to
account for the joint behavior of life-cycle choices.

<em>Abstract:</em> In a neoclassical growth model with life-cycle households in which money
  is held to satisfy a cash-in-advance constraint, the optimal steady state
  inflation rate is not the Friedman rule -- it is in excess of 20%.
  Lump-sum, age-independent money injections twist and flatten the lifetime
  profile of utility, making this profile look more like the one that would
  be chosen by a planner.  The cost of monetary finance of lump-sum
  payments is the distortion introduced to the labor-leisure choice.

	<P></p>
	<EM>Abstract:</EM> Government expenditures are large when measured
	as a proportion of government spending or relative to GNP. This
	fact is incorporated into an endogenous growth model in which
	education produces new human capital. Capital in the education
	sector is provided by government and financed by distortionary
	taxes. To incorporate property taxes, an important source of
	revenues for schooling, household production is incorporated into
	the model with household capital representing the property tax
	base. The model is calibrated to match key first moment properties
	of the post-war U.S. economy. Different mixes of labor income,
	capital income and property taxes are analyzed with regard to their
	consequences for the welfare of the representative household. In
	general, taxes have two opposing effects: higher taxes tend to
	retard growth and reduce welfare; however, when used to finance
	educational expenditures, taxes promote human capital accumulation
	and so growth which is welfare-enhancing.
