	      <p><em>Abstract:</em> Tax-based deficit reduction experiments for the U.S. and
	      EMU-12 are conducted using an open economy model.  In welfare terms,
	      raising the consumption tax is the least costly, followed by the labor
	      income tax, then the capital income tax. Use of an open economy model
	      means that the incidence of the consumption tax is borne in part by
	      foreign producers.  Among revenue-neutral tax experiments, partially
	      replacing the capital income tax is welfare-enhancing, although there are
	      short term losses. Replacing labor income tax revenue with a consumption
	      tax improves international competitiveness and is welfare-improving.</p>

	      <p><em>Abstract:</em> It is well known that the Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides

	      <p><em>Abstract:</em> Capturing the boom phase of Pigou cycles and resolving

	      model.  Price rigidities dampen movements in the relative price of

	      are estimated to be complements in utility, allowing for a resolution
	      of the comovement problem for modest degrees of price rigidity.
	      Nominal rigidities also make firms forward-looking in their pricing
	      behaviour which leads to relative price dynamics that generate positive
	      sectoral comovement in the boom phase of a Pigou cycle.</p>

	      <p><em>Abstract:</em>
	      A widely cited failing of real business cycle models is their 
	      inability to account for the cyclical patterns of financial
	      variables. Perhaps less well known is the fact that the return to capital
	      and equity are identical in the neoclassical growth model.  This paper
	      constructs a measure of the return to business capital for the U.S. The S&P
	      500 return is roughly six times more volatile than the return to
	      business capital. Owing to the equivalence between the returns to capital
	      and equity in the neoclassical growth model, papers in the real business
	      cycle literature that successfully account for the time series variation
	      in the S&P 500 return must fail to account for the time series properties
	      of the return to capital. A fairly basic real business cycle model
	      captures most of the observed variability in the return to capital. What
	      is needed is a theory of the stock market that breaks the equivalence
	      between the returns to equity and capital.</p>

	      Calibration has become a standard tool of macroeconomics. This paper
	      extends and refines the calibration methodology along several important
	      dimensions. First, accounting for home production is important both in
	      measuring calibration targets and in organizing the data in a
	      model-consistent fashion. For this reason, thinking about home production
	      is important even if the model under consideration does not include home
	      production. Second, investment-specific technological change is included
	      because of its strong balanced growth parameter restrictions. Third, the
	      measurement strategy is laid out as transparently as possible so that
	      others can easily replicate the underlying calculations.</p>

		Review</EM> (with David Andolfatto) 44 (1), February 2003, pages 1-30.</p>

	      <p><EM>Abstract:</EM> 
	      This paper investigates the role of beliefs over monetary policy in
	      propagating the effects of monetary policy shocks within the context of a
	      dynamic, stochastic general equilibrium model.  In our model, monetary
	      policy periodically switches between low and high money growth regimes.
	      When individuals are unable to observe the regime directly, they 
	      form inferences over regime-type based on historical money growth rates.
	      For an empirically plausible money growth process, beliefs
	      evolve slowly in the wake of a regime change.  As a result, our model is
	      able to capture some of the observed persistence of real and nominal
	      variables following such a regime change.</p>

		Economic Review</EM> 40 (1), February 1999, pages 3-21.</p>


	      <p><EM>Abstract:</EM> Empirically, real wages exhibit relatively little
	      cyclical variation and a weak cyclical pattern. Early real business cycle
	      models predict, to the contrary, large, procyclical real wage
	      movements. Incorporating efficiency wages into a real business cycle
	      environment would seem promising since one prediction from the efficiency
	      wage literature is real wage rigidity. This paper evaluates a common
	      microfoundation for efficiency wages, the shirking model, with respect to
	      its predictions for real wages within a real business cycle-style
	      model. Simulations of the model reveal that it can generate dampened, but
	      still strongly procyclical real wage behavior.</p>

              (with David Andolfatto and Paul Storer) 24 (S1), February 1998,
              pp. 210-232.</p>


	      <p><EM>Abstract:</EM> In this paper, we investigate the extent to which
	      changes in U.S. labour market policy in the 1980s may have
	      contributed to the emergence of an unemployment rate gap between
	      Canada and the United States. In that decade, unemployment
	      insurance benefits became taxable, income tax rates fell
	      substantially, and various administrative changes were made that
	      effectively tightened unemployment insurance eligibility
	      requirements. These policy changes are evaluated in the context of
	      a computable equilibrium model of the labour market. Our estimates
	      suggest that all of these reforms together can account for no more
	      than a 0.4 percentage point decline in U.S. natural rate of
	      unemployment; a combined effect which accounts for 20 percent of
	      the unemployment rate gap.</p>

	      <p><EM>Abstract:</EM> Conventional wisdom is that if public policy can

	  <p><a href="household-revolution.pdf"> ``The
	      Household Revolution: Childcare, Housework, and Female Labor Force
	      Participation''</a> (with Emanuela Cardia)</p>
	  
	  <p><em>Abstract:</em> Over the twentieth century, the amount of time that
	    married women devoted to working in the market increased dramatically.
	    This paper explores the implications for the allocation of women's time
	    stemming from: (1) the durable goods revolution associated with the
	    introduction of new technologies, from running water to modern appliances,
	    that significantly reduced the time demands of home production; (2) the
	    increase in the relative wage of women, from roughly 50% to over 80%; and
	    (3) changes in childcare requirements associated with changes in fertility
	    patterns.  To do so, we construct a life-cycle model with home production
	    and childcare constraints.  The parameters of the childcare production
	    function are chosen to match micro evidence from U.S. time use data.  We
	    find that the increase in the relative wage of women is the most important
	    explanation of the increase in married women's market work time over the
	    twentieth century.  Increases in relative wages and decreases in fertility
	    can also explain a large part of the observed decrease in housework.  The
	    model find that the the declining price of durable goods has an appreciable
	    effect only since 1980.</p>

	  <p><a href="3regime.pdf">``Estimating Canadian Monetary Policy Regimes''</a>
	    (with David Andolfatto)</p>


	  <p><em>Abstract:</em> Andolfatto and Gomme (2003) find evidence that Canadian
	    monetary policy appears to alternate between high and low money growth
	    rate regimes, and that private-sector belief formation over these
	    unobserved regimes could induce significant persistence in the
	    propagation of monetary policy shocks. In this paper, we examine the
	    sensitivity of these conclusions by re-estimating the data allowing for
	    the possibility of multiple regimes. In doing so, we find evidence of
	    three (rather than two) distinct monetary policy regimes. In particular,
	    we find that one policy regime is characterized by high money growth with
	    moderate variability. The other two policy regimes are characterized by a
	    common low money growth rate; they are distinguished primarily by their
	    variability (high and low). A simulation exercise based on our
	    three-regime model reveals an improvement in accounting for the behavior
	    of the Canadian economy over some episodes; notably, the sharp increase
	    in interest rates and the curtailment of economic activity in the early
	    1980s.</p>

	      Earning, Income and Wealth''</a> (with David Andolfatto and Christopher
	    Ferral)</p>


	  <p><em>Abstract:</em> Life-cycle patterns of income, earnings, consumption, labor supply, and
	    wealth vary systematically across educational groups. Human capital theory
	    explains different educational choices in terms of parameters describing
	    tastes and technology. We ask whether differences in these parameters are
	    also consistent with other patterns of behavior. Our preliminary findings
	    suggest that no single form of parameter heterogeneity will be able to
	    account for the joint behavior of life-cycle choices. </p>

	  <p>``Optimal Taxation in an Endogenous Growth Model with Government
	Supplied Educational Capital'' (available as a
	<A HREF="./education.ps">postscript</A> file)</p>

	<p><EM>Abstract:</EM> Government expenditures are large when measured
	as a proportion of government spending or relative to GNP. This
	fact is incorporated into an endogenous growth model in which
	education produces new human capital. Capital in the education
	sector is provided by government and financed by distortionary
	taxes. To incorporate property taxes, an important source of
	revenues for schooling, household production is incorporated into
	the model with household capital representing the property tax
	base. The model is calibrated to match key first moment properties
	of the post-war U.S. economy. Different mixes of labor income,
	capital income and property taxes are analyzed with regard to their
	consequences for the welfare of the representative household. In
	general, taxes have two opposing effects: higher taxes tend to
	retard growth and reduce welfare; however, when used to finance
	educational expenditures, taxes promote human capital accumulation
	and so growth which is welfare-enhancing.</p>

	<p><EM>Abstract:</EM> Evolutionary programming is a stochastic
	optimization procedure which has proved useful in optimizing
	difficult functions. It is shown that Evolutionary programming can
	be used to solve the Bellman equation problem with a high degree of
	accuracy and substantially less CPU time than Bellman equation
	iteration. Future applications will focus on sometimes binding
	constraints - a class of problem for which standard solutions

	<P><EM>Abstract:</EM> Sufficient conditions for the long run
	non-superneutrality of money are established in a neoclassical
	growth model with a labor-leisure choice.  Money is held to satisfy
	a cash-in-advance constraint on consumption purchases. Production
	requires capital and labor while period utility depends on
	consumption and leisure. The most important sufficient conditions
	for increased money growth to reduce output in the long run are:
	(1) the crosspartial derivative of the production function is
	  non-negative, and (2) the crosspartial derivative of the period
	  utility function is non-negative.</p>
